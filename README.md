Overall ethos is to be mindful that we are a 2 man team with full time jobs and both want free time. 
Thus the objective is to keep everything as simple and unncomplicated as possible.

The overall selling point of the platform is to reward creators, but be tailored for ease of use to people using the recipes.

Main features (open to changing/editing)
- Recipe creation needs to be restrictive to the creator such that they cannot overload the recipe with information.
- Weighted rating system, i.e. more trusted user ratings have more impact.
- Advanced search bar (filter by tools, ingredients, cuisine etc) also priority to higher rated recipes
- Reward the creators with ad revenue on their recipes, also need links to their other platforms, and donations.
- (possible not sure of legality) import a number of recipes from the internet into our format.
